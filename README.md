# cloudfare-captcha

cloudfare-captcha is a script designed to automate the interaction with Cloudflare CAPTCHA challenges on web pages using drissionpage. It demonstrates how to programmatically locate and interact with CAPTCHA elements, potentially for testing or automation purposes.

- Locate the Cloudflare CAPTCHA challenge on a web page.
- Find the relevant iframe or image element.
- Interact with the CAPTCHA checkbox element to attempt to solve or bypass the challenge.
